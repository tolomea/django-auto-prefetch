Automatically prefetch foreign key values as needed.

Purpose
-------

When accessing a ``ForeignKey`` or ``OneToOneField`` (including in reverse) on
a model instance, if the field’s value has not yet been loaded then
auto-prefetch will prefetch the field for all model instances loaded by
the same ``QuerySet`` as the current model instance. This is enabled at the
model level and totally automatic and transparent for users of the
model.

Requirements
------------

Python 3.6 to 3.10 supported.

Django 2.2 to 4.0 supported.

Usage
-----

1. Install with ``python -m pip install django-auto-prefetch``.

2. Change all these imports from ``django.db.models`` to ``auto_prefetch``:

-  ``ForeignKey``
-  ``Manager``
-  ``Model``
-  ``OneToOneField``
-  ``QuerySet``

For example, if you had:

.. code:: python

   from django.db import models


   class Book(models.Model):
       author = models.ForeignKey("Author", on_delete=models.CASCADE)

…swap to:

.. code:: python

   import auto_prefetch
   from django.db import models


   class Book(auto_prefetch.Model):
       author = auto_prefetch.ForeignKey("Author", on_delete=models.CASCADE)

If you use custom subclasses of any of these classes, you should be able
to swap for the ``auto_prefetch`` versions in your subclasses’ bases.

3. Run ``python manage.py makemigrations`` to generate migrations, which set
   the ``Meta.base_manager_name`` option
   (`docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/options/#base-manager-name>`__)
   to ``prefetch_manager`` on every model you’ve converted. This is to make
   sure auto-prefetching happens on related managers. If you instead set
   ``Meta.base_manager_name`` on your models, make sure it inherits from
   ``auto_prefetch.Manager``.

Background and Rationale
------------------------

Currently when accessing an uncached foreign key field, Django will
automatically fetch the missing value from the database. When this
occurs in a loop it creates 1+N query problems. Consider the following
snippet:

.. code:: python

   for choice in Choice.objects.all():
       print(choice.question.question_text, ":", choice.choice_text)

This will do one query for the choices and then one query per choice to
get that choice’s question.

This behavior can be avoided with correct application of
``prefetch_related()`` like this:

.. code:: python

   for choice in Choice.objects.prefetch_related("question"):
       print(choice.question.question_text, ":", choice.choice_text)

This has several usability issues, notably:

* Less experienced users are generally not aware that it’s necessary.
* Cosmetic seeming changes to things like templates can change the fields that
  should be prefetched.
* Related to that, the code that requires the ``prefetch_related()`` (e.g. the
  template) may be quite removed from where the ``prefetch_related()`` needs to
  be applied (e.g. the view).
* Subsequently finding where ``prefetch_related()`` / ``select_related()``
  calls are missing is non-trivial and needs to be done on an ongoing
  basis.
* Excess entries in ``prefetch_related()`` calls are even harder
  to find and result in unnecessary database queries.
* It is very difficult for libraries like the admin and Django Rest Framework
  to automatically generate correct ``prefetch_related()`` clauses.

On the first iteration of the loop in the example above, when we first
access a choice’s question field, instead of fetching the question for
just that choice, auto-prefetch will speculatively fetch the questions
for all the choices returned by the ``QuerySet``. This change results in
the first snippet having the same database behavior as the second while
reducing or eliminating all of the noted usability issues.

Some important points:

* ``ManyToManyField``\s are not changed at all.
* Because these are ``ForeignKey`` and ``OneToOneField``\s, the
  generated queries can’t have more result rows than the original query
  and may have less. This eliminates any concern about a multiplicative
  query size explosion.
* This feature will never result in more database queries as a prefetch will
  only be issued where the ORM was already going to fetch a single related
  object.
* Because it is triggered by fetching missing related objects it will not at
  all change the DB behavior of code which is fully covered by
  ``prefetch_related()`` and/or ``select_related()`` calls.
* This will inherently chain across relations like ``choice.question.author``.
  The conditions above still hold under such chaining.
* In some rare situations it may result in larger data transfer between the
  database and Django (see below).

An example of that last point is:

.. code:: python

   qs = Choice.objects.all()
   list(qs)[0].question

Such examples generally seem to be rarer and more likely to be visible
during code inspection (vs ``{{ choice.question }}`` in a template). And
larger queries are usually a better failure mode than producing hundreds
of queries. For this to actually produce inferior behavior in practice
you need to:
* fetch a large number of choices
* filter out basically all of them
* ...in a way that prevents garbage collection of the unfiltered ones

If any of those aren’t true then automatic prefetching will still
produce equivalent or better database behavior than without.

P.S.
----

If you have concerns go look at the code, it’s all in
`auto_prefetch/__init__.py <https://github.com/tolomea/django-auto-prefetch/blob/main/src/auto_prefetch/__init__.py>`__
and is fairly short.
